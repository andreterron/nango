# This is Nango's own [Nango Folder](https://docs.nango.dev/architecture)

This folder contains a few sample Integrations and Actions that we use for the development of Nango.

## Does Nango only work with the integrations/APIs in this folder?

**No. Nango is API agnostic and works with any HTTP based API (such as REST APIs for instance).**

Nango provides infrastructure that makes working with any API easier, such as:

-   Builtin OAuth (many different types)
-   Automatic access token refreshes
-   Automatic retries of failed requests
-   Automatic rate-limit handling
-   Built-in detailed logs
-   etc.

Learn more about the features of Nango from the [main Readme](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) and [our docs](https://docs.nango.dev).

## Are these the Blueprints Nango provides?

**No. You can find all the 25+ (and growing) Nango Blueprints in our [Blueprints Catalog](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-overview)**

We have Blueprints for many more APIs, such as:

-   [Airtable](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-airtable)
-   [Discord](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-discord)
-   [Microsoft Teams](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-ms-teams)
-   [Gitlab](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-gitlab)
-   [Gmail](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-google-mail) & [Google Calendar](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-google-calendar)
-   [Intercom](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-intercom)
-   [Xero](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-xero)
-   etc.

Note that whilst Blueprints speed up the development of new Integrations they are not necessary to use Nango: Even if we do not have a Blueprint for an API yet you can easily use it with Nango and benefit from all the features mentioned above.
