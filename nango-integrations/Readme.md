# This is Nango's own [Nango Folder](https://docs.nango.dev/architecture)

This folder contains a few sample Integrations and Actions that we use for the development of Nango.

## Does Nango only work with the integrations/APIs in this folder?

**No. Nango is API agnostic and works with any HTTP based API (such as REST APIs for instance).**

Nango provides infrastructure that makes working with any API easier, such as builtin OAuth, automatic token refreshes, automatic retries, automatic rate-limit handling, built-in detailed logs etc.
Learn more about the features of Nango from the [main Readme](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) and [our docs](https://docs.nango.dev).

## Are these the Blueprints Nango provides?

**No. You can find all the 25+ (and growing) Nango Blueprints in our [Blueprints Catalog](https://docs.nango.dev/blueprint-catalog/blueprint-overview)**

Note that whilst Blueprints speed up the development of new Integrations they are not necessary to use Nango: Even if we do not have a Blueprint for an API yet you can easily use it with Nango and benefit from all the features mentioned above.
