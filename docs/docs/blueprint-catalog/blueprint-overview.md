# Blueprints Overview

Blueprints are pre-built integrations for standard use-cases. They are built and maintained both by Nango and the Nango community. Blueprints are indicative, you do not need to use them to build integrations with Nango.

## Pre-built Integrations

Integration Blueprints contain:
- Integration-specific API configuration (e.g. base API URL, default rate limit, etc.)
- Out-of-the-box support for OAuth & token refresh

## Pre-built Actions

Action Blueprints cover standard use-cases (e.g. send a message on Slack). They can be used as is or as a base to extend. They are licensed under the same permissive license as Nango itself so you can use them without having to worry about licensing.

:::info
The Blueprints effort is in progress. Currently, Blueprints are mostly meant as examples for how to implement Integrations and Actions. We plan on having many more Blueprints soon, as well as a thorough QA, documentation & contribution process for them.
