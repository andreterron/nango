# Migrating from Pizzly V0.2

Last update: 29th Nov 2022

Pizzly v0.3, the current version on the master branch, is a rewrite of Pizzly to modernize it and improve development speed.

Whilst Pizzly v0.3 is rapidly getting better it is not quite at feature parity with v0.2.2 yet (especially the proxy is missing, we are on it!).

If you are a current v0.2.x user please join us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) where we share the latest updates in a Pizzly channel. We hope that v0.3 will be production ready for everyone soon and plan on having a migration guide here.
