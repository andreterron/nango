# Nango Cloud

If you don't want to self-host Nango, ask for a ready-to-use Nango instance on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack).

For fast experimentation, Nango is easy to self-host on a single machine with Docker (cf. [Deploy Nango](category/deploy-nango-open-source)).

We plan on releasing a self-served Nango Cloud version in the coming months (mark your interest [here](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/4)).
