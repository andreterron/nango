# Local Development

## Overview

Nango is purposely built to optimize your local development experience:

- The **Nango Folder** lives in your existing project's repository so you can leverage your usual coding environment.
- The **Nango Server** runs locally with Docker, hot-reloading integrations files from the Nango Folder. This lets you run and test integrations as you code.

Nango also provides a CLI to simplify common workflows such as initializing Nango, adding a new Integration or Action etc. 

Get started with local development with the [Quickstart](quickstart/node.md).
