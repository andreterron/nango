# Cloud Edition

## Overview

![Nango Self-Hosted](/img/nango-cloud.png)

Glad you asked! Yes, we plan on offering a cloud-hosted version which will take care of running the [Nango Server](architecture.md) for you. You will write Integrations code locally, in the Nango Folder, and deploy to the Nango Server with a single CLI command.

The core Nango infrastructure will always be open-source and we plan to always support a self-hosted version for community and enterprise customers.
