# Contributing

Nango is under active development and we welcome all contributions and feedback!

You want to contribute? Awesome, we have collected some [good first issues](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) for you and we would love to help you get setup with your local development environment.

To contribute or share feedback, please join our [community Slack](https://nango.dev/slack) and let us know you want to participate (or just open a first PR, even better :)). Post in the [#general channel](https://nango-community.slack.com/archives/C03QBHSMPUM) or ping @robin and @bastien directly.  Thank you! ❤️
