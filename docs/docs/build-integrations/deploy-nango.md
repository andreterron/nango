# Deploying Nango

:::warning
Nango is Alpha software and not ready for production.

We have included this section here to give you an overview of the deployment process and how it will work, but we strongly advise against using Nango in a production environment. If you want to deploy Nango to server for staging or testing please reach out on our [community Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/nango-community/shared_invite/zt-1cvpdflmb-TMrjJJ_AZJeMivOgt906HA) and we will be glad to assist you!
