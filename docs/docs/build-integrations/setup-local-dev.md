`cd` to the `nango-integrations` folders.
```bash
cd nango-integrations
```

# Set up the Nango runtime

Start the Nango server docker container:
```bash
docker compose up # or docker-compose up
```

Give it a few seconds and then you should see `âœ… Nango Server is ready!`

This command will fetch the Docker image and start the Docker containers for the Nango runtime.

You can see the the Nango runtime as an independent micro-service. It is the unified system that communicates with the 3rd-party APIs powering your integrations. In the context of this tutorial, the Nango runtime will initiate the HTTP requests to the Slack API.

:::info
Nango's runtime automatically loads the integrations from your `nango-integrations` folder contained in your project to power your native integrations.
:::

# Set up the Node environment

In a new terminal, navigate to the `nango-integrations` folder inside your project.

The `nango-integrations` is configured as an [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) package. As such, it contains a `package.json` file at the root. 

Our `nango-integrations` package depends on other npm packages that we need to install. For this, just run:
```bash
npm install
```

# Set up the Typescript environment
Nango leverages the [typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) programming language to write integrations. Because typescript compiles into javascript, we need to make sure that this compilation happens everytime we modify a typescript file. 

To do so, run the command:
```bash
npm run watch
```

From there on, every typescript file will be compile instead of a newly created `dist` directory inside the `nango-integrations` folder. Any compilation error will show in that terminal window where you ran `npm run watch`.

:::caution
If your main project is a typescript project, you need to exclude the `nango-integrations` folder inside your `tsconfig.json` file. Since `nango-integrations` compiles independently, you do not want your main project to interfer with its compilation process.

Congrats on setting up your development environment! You are ready to create your first integration from scratch.
