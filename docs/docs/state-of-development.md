# State of Development

Nango is currently at an **alpha** stage. Many features are missing, but all the features documented here work. Nango is under very active development, you can expect progress every week.

In particular, **alpha** stage means that:
- Nango can but is not yet optimized to be self-hosted in production
- Client SDKs cover limited programming languages
- Nango Cloud is not yet available
- Some advertised features are still unstable
