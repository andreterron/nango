# State of Development

Nango is currently at an **alpha** stage. Many features are missing, but all the features documented here work. Nango is under very active development, you can expect progress every week.

In particular, **alpha** stage means that:
- Nango can but is not yet optimized to be self-hosted in production
- Client SDKs cover limited programming languages
- Nango Cloud is not yet available
- Some advertised features are still unstable

You can follow our progress and get involved by checking our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues) and the [public Roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/NangoHQ/projects/1/views/1).
