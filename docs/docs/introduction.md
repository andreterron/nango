## ⭐ Why Nango

Building native integrations becomes harder as you support more integrations, deeper integrations and higher traffic.

Most teams today are building native integrations in their main application code, with or without an internal framework, and quickly face serious issues regarding:

- Rate limiting
- Scheduling, queuing and retries
- Error handling
- Monitoring, alerting & debugging
- Local development & testing
- Data modeling & merging different schemas
- Authentication
- 3rd party API limitations: missing docs, down-time, migrations, etc.

Our team built dozens of integrations, spent hundreds of hours on maintenance, and we had enough! It’s time for universal tooling that will 10x the productivity of any developer building native integrations.

This is why we built Nango, an open-source framework built on 3 core principles: 

- **Simplicity:**  A simple yet powerful abstraction that makes common use cases easy and the difficult ones possible
- **Reliability:** Robust in every way, no matter how many integrations and traffic you throw at it
- **Extensibility:** Nango will never stand in your way to build deep, native integrations with unlimited customizations


## State of development

Nango is currently **alpha software**.

Many of the core features are missing, but the framework and core APIs documented here all work. Nango is under very active development, you can expect progress every week.
