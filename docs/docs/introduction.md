# The unified API for CRM integrations

![Nango Overview](/img/nango-overview.png)

## What is a unified API?
Our unified API allows you to integrate with 12+ CRM systems (and more every week) by implementing a single API.

This means you integrate once with Nango and actually get 12+ integrations with the most popular CRM systems.

When you call `/crm/contacts` you always get the same data schema back no matter which CRM your user has setup:
- Salesforce
- Copper
- Hubspot
- Close
- Pipedrive
- ...and 8 more

Check our [Fetching contacts](fetch-contacts.md) to see it in action.

## Why should I use the Nango unified API?
Building CRM integrations one-by-one is slow and costly.

There are hundreds of CRMs out there with very different APIs. For each one, you need to understand their API reference, data modeling, developer approval process, authentication system, rate limiting, etc.

Nangoâ€™s unified API lets you integrate once and get 12+ native CRM integrations.

And if you want to go even deeper you can leverage the [open source](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango) aspect of Nango to customize the unified API and support new CRM systems.

## This is cool, how can I try & use it?
Check out the docs in the sidebar to the left for our different API endpoints.

If you want to try it [apply for access](https://wk5v3fpmd37.typeform.com/to/nrszQmvN) here or reach out to us on the [community Slack](https://nango.dev/slack), we enable access on a rolling basis!
