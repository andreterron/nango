# Quickstart

## Goal
Within the next **5 minutes** you will build a **Slack integration that posts a message** to the #welcome channel of our community Slack âœ¨

You will learn:
- How the Nango framework structure works
- How to run Nango locally for development
- How to call an Action from Nango
- See an example of the detailed logging Nango provides you from the start

Ready? Let's go!

## Installing Nango locally
Start by creating a directory for our test of Nango:

```bash
mkdir nango-test
cd nango-test
```

And clone the Nango github repo into it:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nangohq/nango.git
```
