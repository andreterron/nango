# Quickstart

Let's test Nango and send a message to the #welcome channel on our community Slack [[LINK]] in 30 seconds.

## Start the clock & let's go!
Clone the Nango repo & move into the example dir:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nangohq/nango.git
cd nango/examples/quickstart
```

Open the `run-quickstart.js` file and edit the highlighted lines:
```javascript {3-4,6} title="run-quickstart.js"
...
// TODO: Edit these to your liking
const yourName = 'YourName';
const slackMessage = `Hello ${yourName}, welcome to Nango! :wave:`;

await nango.registerConnection('slack', 1, 'xoxb-XXXXXXXXXXXXXX'); // TODO: Get the 'xoxb-' access token from the pinned message in #welcome on our commmunity Slack
...
```

Start the Nango server docker container:
```bash
cd nango-integrations
docker compose up # or docker-compose up
```

Open a new terminal, CD to the example folder and run `run-quickstart.js`:
```bash
node run-quickstart.js
```

You should see a success message, check the #welcome channel in our Slack and you should see your personal greeting ðŸŽ‰
