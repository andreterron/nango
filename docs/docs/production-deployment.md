# Deploying Nango to production

## Self-hosted
For fast experimentation, Nango is very simple to self-host on a single machine with the `docker compose up` command (cf. [Quickstart](quickstart.md)). This command will automatically run a network of docker containers powering Nango.

For production use-cases, please reach out on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we will assist you with setting up Nango in your preferred production environment.

## Nango Cloud: Available on request
A self-service Nango Cloud is currently under development (mark your interest [here please](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/4)), but in the meantime we can set up and host a cloud instance for you at any time. Please reach out to us on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we are happy to set it up for you.  

Nango Cloud provides simple Syncs, at any scale, without the burden of self-hosting. It runs on production grade infrastructure, with a single tenant option upon request, so you can focus on building great applications relying on 3rd-party APIs without having to worry about the infrastructure.

## Deploy via Render
While we develop a self-service Nango Cloud, we offer an easy way to deploy Nango via [Render](https://render.com) with a pre-built [Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code). While not optimized for very-high-volume use-cases (yet), you can get started in production with this in a couple of minutes. If you need help with the deployment please reach out in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we are happy to get you setup.
