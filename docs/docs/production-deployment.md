## Self-hosted
For fast experimentation, Nango is very simple to self-host on a single machine with the `docker compose up` command (cf. [Quickstart](quickstart.md)). This command will automatically run a network of docker containers powering Nango.

For production use-cases, please reach out on the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) and we will assist you with setting up Nango in your preferred production environment.

## Nango Cloud
Nango Cloud is currently under development but will be available soon. Mark your interest on [this Github issue](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues/4) or ask about it in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack).

Nango Cloud will provide simple syncs, at any scale, without the burden of self-hosting. It will run on production grade infrastructure, with a single tenant option upon request, so you can focus on building great applications relying on 3rd-party APIs. 

## Deploy via Render
While we develop Nango Cloud, we offer an easy way to deploy Nango via [Render](render.com) with a pre-built [Blueprint](https://render.com/docs/infrastructure-as-code). While not optimized for very-high-volume use-cases (yet), you can get started in production in a couple minutes. Please reach out in the [Slack community](https://nango.dev/slack) to get started with Nango + Render.
