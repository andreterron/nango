# Blueprint: Close

This blueprint of Nango for the Close API makes it very easy to work with the Close REST API and automates common tasks such as OAuth 2 authentication, requests authorization, logging, rate-limit handling, error handling and automatic retries.

## How to use it
To create your own integration based on the Close blueprint add this to your `integrations.yaml` file:

```yaml title=integrations.yaml
    close:
        extends_blueprint: close:v0

```
The Close API uses [Basic Auth for authorization](https://developer.close.com/topics/authentication/) but only uses the "username" part which should be set to an API key of the user. The API key can be generated by your user in Close and should then be supplied to your frontend. Once you have it you can register the user's Connection in Nango with a call to [`registerConnection`](reference/SDKs/node.md#registerConnection) like this:

```js title="In your backend, using the Nango SDK"

let credentials = {
    username: '<Close API Key from your frontend/user>',
    password: '' // Password must be empty, but you need to specify the key
};

await nango.registerConnection('close', '<user-id>', credentials);
// Connection registered, you can now start executing Close actions for this user
```

### Coverage
Blueprint `v0` covers the Close REST API V1.

The base URL for API calls is set to `https://api.close.com/api/v1/`

| Nango Feature | Supported Status |
