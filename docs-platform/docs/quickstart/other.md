# Quickstart: Other Languages

Nango is [language agnostic](architecture.md) and we plan to support all major programming languages with native client SDKs (currently planned are PHP, Ruby, Python and Java).

We are leveraging the [alpha](state-of-development.md) stage to develop these SDKs and are also open to contributions in this area.

If your language in not in the Quickstart list, reach out in our community Slack's [#general channel](https://nango-community.slack.com/archives/C03QBHSMPUM) or directly message @robin or @bastien. Alternatively you can also check our [GitHub issues](https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango/issues) and open an issue there if it does not yet exist.
