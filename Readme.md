## ‚≠ê¬†Can you show me an example?

In your code you write:

```ts
Nango.sync('https://api.hubspot.com/crm/v3/contacts', ...); // Starts syncing contacts forever!
```

Nango then takes care of:

-   Pagination & full first sync
-   Periodic refresh with incremental syncs
-   Deduplication of records & upserts of changed data
-   Detecting schema changes & alert you
-   Automatic retries & rate-limit handling
-   Making sure your sync is robust, so you never again have to worry about stuck/stale syncs or manual restarts

## üßë‚Äçüíª Cool, what can I build with it?

-   Teams in SaaS companies use Nango to **build native in-app integrations** related to CRM contacts, payment transactions, HRIS employees, etc.
-   Some **automate their personal lives** with Nango by syncing bank transactions or saved cooking recipes for further processing
-   Nango can help you **quickly build proof of concepts** (which are easy to make production-grade) for hackathon projects, internal evaluations or to test the technical feasibility of your next big idea

## üöÄ¬†Interesting, how can I try it?

Let's setup your first Sync in 3 minutes!

It will pull [the full list of Pok√©mons](https://pokeapi.co/) to a local Postgres database (and keep it in sync, they love to evolve!).

Clone the repo and start Nango locally...

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NangoHQ/nango.git
cd nango && docker compose up
```

...and create a Sync with a simple CURL command:

```bash
curl --request POST \
    --url http://localhost:3003/v1/syncs \
    --header "Content-type: application/json" \
    --data '{"url": "https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon", "response_path": "results", "paging_url_path":"next"}'
```

That's all it takes! You can check out [the list of all Pok√©mons in your local database](http://localhost:8080/?pgsql=nango-db&username=nango&db=nango&ns=public&select=_nango_sync_1) (password is `nango`).

In practice, you probably want to use one of our native SDKs to interact with Nango's API ([see docs](https://docs.nango.dev)), e.g. for Node.JS:

```js
import { Nango } from '@nangohq/node-client';

let config = {
    response_path: 'results', // The path to the Pok√©mons objects in the response.
    paging_url_path: 'next' // The path to the next page's url in the response.
};

await Nango.sync('https://pokeapi.co/api/v2/pokemon', config);
```

## üîç Neat, I would like to learn more
