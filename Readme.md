## ‚≠ê¬†Why

Building CRM integrations one-by-one is slow and costly.

There are hundreds of CRMs out there with very different APIs. For each one, you need to understand their API reference, data modeling, developer approval process, authentication system, rate limiting, etc.

Most companies end up building the same infrastructure: scheduling, queueing, error handling, retries, authentication, logging, local development environment, CI/CD, etc.

Nango's goal is to make integration developers 10x more productive by providing them with a single CRM API, abstracting away all external CRM APIs and underlying integrations infrastructure.

## ‚úÖ¬†How It Works

1. Simply embed Nango's UI component to let users pick and authenticate to their favorite CRM.

2. Nango will periodically perform two-way syncs with all connected CRMs, abstracting away the various CRM APIs and complex infrastructure.

</div>

3. You can query Nango's Standard API Endpoints and receive standard models. This way, you integrate once with a modern API to unlock many CRM integrations at once.
